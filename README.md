My first R project analyzes factors influencing housing prices in Sweden using data from Kaggle.

The main research question is:

What are the key factors influencing housing prices in Sweden?
This study examines variables such as asking price, living area, typology, land area, and number of rooms using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and econometric models.

Key findings include:

Living area and number of rooms significantly impact housing prices.
Houses tend to be priced higher than apartments.
Land area has a weaker correlation with price, suggesting urban preferences.
This project is valuable for policymakers, investors, and urban planners, offering insights into Swedenâ€™s housing market trends. Future research could incorporate temporal data and regional disparities to refine the analysis.
